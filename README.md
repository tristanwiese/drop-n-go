Drop n Go is a mobile application that uses Google Nearby places and Maps API to gather locations near you and displays it using a simple UI

This project was used for me to learn how to use API's.

Features include:
- Saving favourite locations to revisit or to look for places later after dropping the pin
- Selecting a specific place and using Google maps to travel to the location
- Filter specific types of interests to find exacly what you need near you
